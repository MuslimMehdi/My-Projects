This is pure human with many mistakes but the bank.py is this code but improved and edited by Blackbox(an AI assisted LLM)
This would have looked better if I had used a flow chart 


class Account :
    def __init__(self, balance, withdraw_or_deposit):
        self.balance = int(balance)
        self.withdraw_or_deposit =int(withdraw_or_deposit)
            
    def updated_balance(self):
          self.balance += self.withdraw_or_deposit
          return self.balance

class Savings_Account(Account):
    def __init__(self,balance,withdraw_or_deposit):
        super().__init__(balance,withdraw_or_deposit)
        self.Savings_profit = balance * 0.1026
        return self.Savings_profit
    

account=Account()

while stop == False:

    b = int(input("""Which account would you loke to use:\n1. Current Account\n2. Savings Account\n\n:"""))
    a = int(input("What would you like to do :\n1. Deposit\n2. Withdraw\n3. View Balance\n\n:"))

    elif a == 2:

        i = -i

    elif a == 3:
        print (f"{account.updated_balance():,}")
     
    else:
        print("Invalid Response")
